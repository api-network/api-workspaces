    to VAT. The API includes De Minimis and VAT amounts for almost 80 countries in
    that country\u2019s currency."

- name: FTA Tariff Rates API
  description: 'The FTA Tariff Rates API provides data about each country with whom
    the United States has a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). When the U.S. enters into
    an FTA with a foreign government, it negotiates lower tariff rates with that government
    for a wide variety of products. A tariff is a tax that a company must pay a foreign
    country when shipping a product to that country. Typically the FTA tariffs rates
    decline over several years. The API provides information on tariff rates for the
    following countries: Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican
    Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama,
    Peru, Singapore, and South Korea. Products are indicated by their HS-6 code. Because
    the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) tariff rates have declined to
    zero, Canada and Mexico data is not included. Similarly, the tariff rates for
    almost all products shipped to Israel and Jordon have declined to zero and are
    not included here.'
