name: Auckland Museum
description: <p>For the past 160 years, our Curators, Collection Managers, and volunteers
  have been creating descriptions, classifications and taxonomies &mdash; meaning
  we have amassed a huge amount of data about the objects in our care. One of the
  aims of Future Museum is to open up our collections and engage with online communities.
  The public API, which allows detailed open access to collection data, is a major
  part of our 'open first, closed by exception' approach that fulfils this aim. This
  service allows you to search across approximately one million objects including
  Natural Science specimens, cultural collections, archives, library items and Online
  Cenotaph records.</p>
