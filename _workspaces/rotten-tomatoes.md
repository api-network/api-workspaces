name: Rotten Tomatoes
description: <p>Rotten Tomatoes is a website launched in August 1998 devoted to film
  reviews and news; it is widely known as a film review aggregator. Coverage now includes
  TV content as well. The name derives from the practice of audiences throwing rotten
  tomatoes when disapproving of a poor stage performance. The company was created
  by Senh Duong and since January 2010 has been owned by Flixster, which itself was
  acquired in 2011 by Warner Bros.</p>
