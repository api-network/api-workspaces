- name: Consumer Complaint Database
  description: 'The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about
    consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response.
    Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship
    with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred
    to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less
    than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database.
    The database generally updates daily. '

- name: Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)
  description: The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many financial institutions
    to maintain, report, and publicly disclose loan-level information about mortgages.
    These data help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their communities;
    they give public officials information that helps them make decisions and policies;
    and they shed light on lending patterns that could be discriminatory. The public
    data are modified to protect applicant and borrower privacy.
