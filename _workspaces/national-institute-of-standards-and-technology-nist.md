  description: "This NIST Data Discovery web portal hosts access to a RestFul web
    service public API, Application Programming Interface. This API provides our developer
    community the capability to dynamically query the underlying data resource catalog,
    a collection of key NIST research dataset descriptions (metadata). The search
    API returns JSON open-standard format data objects containing high level resource
    information and scientific domain specific metadata representations. We are in
    the process of extending these results as our data holdings increase in NIST\u2019s
    Public Data Repository system to further capabilities in scientific data discovery
    and mining of NIST research public data sets."
